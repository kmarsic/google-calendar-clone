# Google Calendar Clone - React
I randomly got the idea to try and clone the Google Calendar. Not realizing how complex this thing really is, I just dived into it. 4 months in, and it's still an ongoing project. I hope to have most of the calendars functions complete within the next month.
This is something I do in my free time, and I try to do as much as I can when I find the time.
